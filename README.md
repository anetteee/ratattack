├── android                 
├── core                                   
├── desktop                    
├── gradle Scripts
└── README.md
</pre>

### Android folder
The Android folder contains the files *AndroidinterfaceClass* and *AndroidLauncher* wich contains logic for connecting to the realtime firebase database. The same folder also contains the *assets* folder, with images used in the design of the application. 

### Core folder

            ├── GameSettings
            └── RatAttack
</pre>
The *core* folder contains the folders *backend*, *gamecontroller*, *model* and view in addition to the files *GameSettings* and *RatAttack*. The *backend* folder contains logic for fetching and submitting scores to the database.

The files are structured according to the Model-View-Controller pattern. The model and view folders are structured as shown in the tree below. The logic for the buttons used to play the game is placed in the buttons folder. The components are also placed in a seperate folder. The strategy pattern logic, which is used to control the different types of bullets, is placed in the *ShootingStrategy* folder. The different systems such as the collision- and the rendersystem is placed in the *system* folder.

## Known errors
During testing we discovered that a ConccurrentModificationException occurs once in a while when going from Gamescreen to Highscorescreen. The error is most likeley caused by the fact that the highscorelist can be modified while iterating over it in the render method in highscorescreen. Due to the time limit and that the error occurs rarely, fixing the error has not been prioritized. We believe that the problem can be fixed by creating a copy of the linked list. We have tried to fix the error by iteariting over a copy of the list instead of the list itself, but are not quite sure if it worked.
